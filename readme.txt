Object Progress Bars - 1.0.0
Shows progress bars on processing or artisan goods machines. Use keyboard key 'P' to toggle progress bars (configurable).

:: REQUIREMENTS::
• Stardew Valley 1.3
• SMAPI 2.0 or later

:: INSTALLATION::
• Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods

:: FEATURES::
• Calculates percentage progress based on the time left until processing will be complete and total time a machine takes for completion according to wiki.
• Guesses progress for the few machines (Worm Bin, Oil Maker, Cask(?)) that don't have a determinable total time.
• Progress bars closely resemble original game UI.

:: CAVEATS::
• Worm Bin and Oil Maker progress might look inconsistent everytime game is loaded since the total time is being guessed. However they do sort of provide a correct estimation of time left on processing.
• Cask wasn't tested since I don't have a cellar. It's behaviour might be weird.
• Mod was only tested on Linux.

::  CREDITS::
♦ spacechase0's Object Time Left was used as a starting point.
